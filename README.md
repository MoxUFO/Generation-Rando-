# <Random Password Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

i wanted to make a random password generator to apply concepts of iteration, array methods, for loops , and if statements.  
Utimatimly I built this application to make "spy proof" passward. In all seriousness we all get in the habit of using the
same password and it s a cool concept to have something that can create such a complex password at the click of the mouse.
And, at the end of the day who doesnt want the security of a srong password?

## Usage
Clicking On the Red " Generate Password button" will bring up a series of prompt. The first propmt will ask for the desired 
password length set between 8 and 128. This is then followed by 4 confirmation propmpts asking if the user would like 
to include a certain character type( upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and symbols) to the password. This adds
the spciefied charcater type as potential chartacter selection for the password. A password that is the specified length, 
compiled of the specified chartacter types, will display in the text area above the red Generate password button.
