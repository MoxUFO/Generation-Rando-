# <Random Password Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

i wanted to make a random password generator to apply concepts of iteration, array methods, for loops , and if statements.  
Utimatimly I built this application to make "spy proof" passward. In all seriousness we all get in the habit of using the
same password and it s a cool concept to have something that can create such a complex password at the click of the mouse.
And, at the end of the day who doesnt want the security of a srong password?
